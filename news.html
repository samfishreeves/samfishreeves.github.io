Maybe it’s just me, but I just can’t seem to figure out what the worth of a player is when we must assign a dollar value to them.  Especially so without much of a scale to weigh them against. Our league’s first year as a FAAB waiver system has been one filled with overpays that are often made to be the joke, but we should remember we are all in this learning process together. As we gain knowledge and learn how to accurately assess player worth and the individual monetary strategy of our league opponents, we will find less and less comedy in each other, and unlock a new part of this beautiful game we all love.

                    <p>
                        The big story entering week 3? The wheat, and its inevitable seperation from the chaff. You see wheat and chaff normally live in perfect harmony, much like all of our league. It dances idly in the breeze, holding onto one another because they need each other, they love each other. However, every autumn something pretty fucking crazy happens. They leave each other, they become individuals with one holding the clear and obvious value, the wheat. We make delicious cereal from it, some bread, and pretty much nothing else. The chaff however, that dreaded fucking chaff. Useless. Disgusting. Not even fit for pig slop. This is much like how our league is shaking out today. The Fallen Angels paced at the top by fantasy pimps Teteo and Bryan, with four 1-1 teams nipping at their heels, a healthy division where nothing is decided. Then we have the upper elite of Satan’s Squadron, Andrew. Really the only positive from that dreaded division. These teams make up the nutritious and delicious wheat of the league. Those other members not included make up the dreaded chaff. Time will tell if any of these chaff-lings can complete a wheat-like metamorphosis moving into the later weeks, but for now it appears grim.

                <p>
                    The league rests in a murky landscape after the first week of games. What many of us had hoped would be a revealing series of contests to show us clarity in the destinies of our chosen gridiron warriors, could be nothing more than a mirage seen on the horizon. One that as soon as we reach out to grasp the assured realization of our drafts, dissipates as nothing more than an early season load bust. Players this time last year who exploded onto the scene showing what must surely be fantasy stardom often times fell off a steep cliff as soon as their fates returned to the mean, Icarus manifest. All this is to say that as much as some of your surprising, or not so surprising, fantasy studs and duds may have you ripping out your hair or screaming to the heavens in joy, prepare for a market correction in week 2. Be ready to react but not overreact, and most of all don’t not react.

                    <h3>Not superstitious, but a little bit stitious</h3>
                    <p>
                        What’s in a name? Does the effort put into a team name have an effect on a fantasy roster’s performance? In my own career I’ve found that my own superstition of needing to change my team’s name is not only a superstition, but also a signal of my own weekly hands on approach to forming a hopeful championship squad. While sifting through the waiver offerings and formulating trade offers I find it hard not to freshen up the team moniker to reflect my new weekly feeling. Does this mean that a team with a consistent name should expect to perform worse? No! We have only to look towards our own set and forget champion from last year Football Sucks. Now it could be argued that in some ways the stagnant title reflected a squad consisting of 2021 game-breakers Cooper Kupp and Derrick Henry. But I think it just goes to show that there are many paths to victory, just as there are many paths to a great team name.

                    <p>
                        Football fucking rocks man. It’s like turn based strategy in real life. Preset attacks and defenses set before the snap goes live with chances for individual heroism at any second while the play runs its course. Like X-com for people who don’t know how to reset their Wi-Fi.

                <h3>The Queen's Men</h3>
                <p>
                    Lately I’ve found myself pacing about the grounds of my property line, searching for answers. Most of all, what would the queens fantasy lineup look like if she was in the Big Dawgs League. First off, Elizabeth, it should be noted was a raging racist. It is almost assured she would have sooner given back the north to Ireland than she would have a running back the likes of Leonard Fournette fighting in her stead. Similarly important to her love of bigotry was her enjoyment of the Hero RB draft strategy in which Liz would draft a sure fire stud RB early and follow that up with 3-4 rounds of heavy receiver recruitment. So we much assume a lineup following these guidelines would look something like this. <br>

                <p>
                    Round 1: Christian McCaffrey <br><br> White savior of the football skill position, easy <br><br>
                    Round 2: Travis Kelce <br><br>A lucky drop for the monarch, a fantastic choice at a depleted position<br><br>
                    Round 3: Michael Pittman <br><br>The queen’s eyesight did not allow her to completely realize that Michael is mixed race. But great value. <br><br>
                    Pick 4: Adam Thielen <br><br>A reach for sure, but at this point the pool of fantasy relevant caucasians is getting thin.<br><br>
                    Round 5: Dalton Schultz<br><br>Doubling up so early at TE is likely going to come back to bite Elizabeth later in the season.<br><br>
                    Round 6: Rex Burkhead<br><br>Finally time to pick up her second RB, The Queen’s flawed draft strategy is beginning to topple. <br><br>
                    Rounds 7-15<br><br>Hunter Renfrow, Aaron Rodgers, Daniel Carlson, Zach Ertz, Rob Gronkowski, Tyler Lockett, Hunter Henry, Kyle Juszczyk, Andrew Beck.<br><br>
                    Final Record: 4-11
